Programming notes from mechanics meeting:
There will be a weapon triangle of some form, details undecided
Gems stat growth and weapons are defined by gem type.
Unique abilities from gem type, common abilities gained from weapons
Abilities can be shared between gems by some means, perhaps based on support levels.
FE unit combine pair ups are NOT in, pair-up with adjacent ally of your choice IS in (defend/attack?)
Initial impression is that most abilities will be passive like in FE.
